I studied Mechanical Engineering and Business Administration at the RWTH Aachen University in Germany and Industrial Engineering at the Tsinghua University in China. Though I spent much time in an engineering heavy environment, I have developed a fascination for the intersection of computer-technology and end-product.

I strongly believe that the current state of computer technology has yet to propagate across many industries and that truly understanding computers will become a core necessity in many cross-disciplinary functions, in particular to facilitate cross-department communication.

In this blog I illuminate some of the projects that have been keeping me up besides my studies, and share some of my thoughts.
